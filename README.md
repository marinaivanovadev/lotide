# Lotide
A mini clone of the [Lodash](https://lodash.com) library.

## Purpose 

**_BEWARE:_This library was published for leraning purposes. It is _not_ intended for use in production-grade software.**

This project was created and published by me as part of my learnings at Lighthouse Labs.

## Usage

**Install it:**

`npm install @marinaivanovadev/lotide`

**Require it:**
`const _ = require('@marinaivanovadev/lotide');`

**Call it:**

`const results = _.tail([1, 2, 3]) // => [2, 3]`

The following functions are currently implemented:

* `head()`: takes in an array and returns the first element in the array
* `tail()`: takes in an array and returns everything except the first element of the array

* `assertArraysEqual()`: prints an appropriate message after comparing the two arrays
* `without()`: takes in a source array and an itemsToRemove arrays and returns only the items from the source array that are not in the itemsToRemove array

* `countOnly()`: takes in a collection of items and returns a specific subset of those items
* `countLetters()`: takes in a collection of items and returns a specific subset of those items
* `letterPositions()`: takes in a string and returns all indices of letter positions in the string
* `findKeyByValue()`: takes in an object and a value and returns the first key that corresponds to that value
* `eqObjects()`: takes in 2 objects and return true if they are equal and false otherwise
* `assertObjectsEqual()`: takes in 2 objects and returns true if they are equal and false otherwise
* `map()`: takes in an array and a callback and returns a new array based on the results of the callback on each item in the array
* `takeUntil()`: takes in an array and callback and returns a slice of the array based on the criteria specified in the callback
* `findKey()`:  takes in an object and callback and returns the first key that meets the criteria specified in callback
